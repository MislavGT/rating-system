This was a project homework for a Java class.
We had to choose a mathematical problem and implement a solution using Java. Also had to include databases, GUI and multithreading.
Also uses JNI to call C++ functions (implemented for both Linux and Windows).

Mostly inspired by "An Elo-like System for Massive Multiplayer Competitions" by Aram Ebtekar, Paul Liu (https://arxiv.org/abs/2101.00400).

Also examples of the system applied to tennis matches (not massive multiplayer). (https://github.com/JeffSackmann/tennis_atp)
